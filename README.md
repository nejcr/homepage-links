## Notes

`link` is where user will be redirected to. 


Optional `url` gives users ability to use shorter, more meaningful urls. For example, if homepage links is running on http://home.lan, using above config you can use http://home.lan/unify and you'll be automatically redirected to http://192.168.0.12:8080


`icon` is  [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)  name. E.g. `fa-bath` will show [this](http://fontawesome.io/icon/bath/) icon
